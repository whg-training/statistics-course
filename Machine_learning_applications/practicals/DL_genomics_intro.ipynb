        "In this tutorial we will use a convolutional neuronal network to address a fairly basic but common problem in genomics. Given a set of sequences belonging to different classes, what are the characteristics in the DNA sequence that let us distinguish the classes. For example, given a set of promoter and enhancer sequences, we could ask if there are any patterns in the DNA that let us distinguish between the two.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a 'simple' example, think of two ChIP-seq experiments for two different transcription factors. After analysing the ChIP-seq data, we know at what positions in the genome the two factors bind and the majority of binding sites might be distinct. If we extract the underlying sequences and search for DNA patterns that are enriched in the respective sets, we get an idea what DNA sequences the transcription factor might bind and/or which co-factors influence their binding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditionally, people use motif discovery tools for finding overrepresented words and motifs. However, if we move to slightly more complicated questions these methods quickly reach their limits and machine learning approaches become more promising.\n",
        "\n",
        "A more complicated question: If we have multiple sets of enhancers that are active in different tissues and cell types and we have the underlying sequences, can we figure out what sequence patterns are characteristic for what activity? And once we know that can we infer which factors are common and which are tissue specific?\n",
        "\n",
        "For our test dataset we have a simplfied, simulated version of such a task. We simulated 40,000 DNA sequences of length 200 bp. We split them into 4 enhancer classes and populated them with transcription factor binding motifs and other DNA patters to make them distinguishable. However, some motifs are shared between classes, they may overlap each other and are not necessarily perfect matches to the text book motifs. Thats much more how regulatory DNA actually looks like :)!\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use keras to build and train a small convolutional neuronal network to classify our enhancer sequences. Once this network is trained well, we can than investigate how the network has learned to distinguish between the classes and try to relate this back to transcriptions factor motifs and so on.\n",

For example, if we have a match to transcription factor motif in our sequence, we don't necessarily care where exactly this motif lies and a few bp up- or downstream shouldn't make a difference to our predictions.\n",

It is now your task to find better hyperparameters for our network and training procedure to see how high up you can get the accuracy. For doing that, I suggest taking dl_intro.py, commenting out all the code after the training, adjust your hyperparameters and/or network architectures how you like and running it in the terminal via python dl_intro.py.\n",

        "Once you are happy with you network performance or in case you want to jump ahead first and optimize later, we will evaluate our network on the held out validation data. Technically, we only optimized on the training data set but we always kept an eye on the validation data loss as well. We are discarding all nets that do well on the training but worse at the validation (overfitted), therefore we always have an intrinsic bias. The test data set is meant to have never been touched throughout the whole optimization process and we evaluate the perormance of our final model on this set to get an unbiased estimate of its performance."

For many research problems however, we are exactly interested in what the network has learned. What features distinguish a cat from a dog or if it comes to decision making (e.g. health care or self driving cars), we obviously want to be able to understand and be able to justify why a certain decision has been chosen and learn how to correct missbehavior.\n",

The easiest way is to just plot the filter weights.

Unfortunatly, this becomes less straight forward to interpret in deeper layers.
