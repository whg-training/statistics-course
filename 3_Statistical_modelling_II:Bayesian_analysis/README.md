Statistical modelling II: Bayesian analysis
=====================================

This session will introduce principles of Bayesian analysis and applications to genomic datasets.

OVERALL MODULE LEARNING OUTCOMES:
By the end of this module, students should be able to: 
•	Understand and explain the components of Bayesian models - including the prior, likelihood and posterior distributions.
•	Use R to build Bayesian models and perform Bayesian inference.
•	Describe the necessary tools for model checking and comparison and be able to implement those in R.
•	Describe the basics of simple parameter estimation procedures.

PREREQUISITES:

* Students should have a basic knowledge of statistical models and likelihood inference
